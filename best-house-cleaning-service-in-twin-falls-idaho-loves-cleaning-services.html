<p>A basic house cleaning consists of washing sinks, toilets, showers, baths, mirrors, wiping countertops, wiping cabinets and appliances, mopping floors, sweeping, vacuuming, dusting, emptying trash, making the beds, washing and putting away dishes, and light organizing.</p><p>A private cleaner charges 20% to 50% less than a professional cleaning service, has more scheduling flexibility, and may negotiate rates. However, individual home cleaners are not usually licensed or insured. A house cleaning company has set prices, may require a contract, and may send a different cleaner to your home each time.</p><p>Some companies explicitly say "Tip is not required." They take the approach of making sure home cleaners make more money per hour. <a class="wb4765d7780e2d4bf6f4775edb0fa46bc" href="https://lovescleaningservices.ewr1.vultrobjects.com/house-cleaning-service-at-loves-cleaning-services-in-twin-falls-id.html">  Loves Cleaning Services House cleaning service Twin Falls, Idaho</a>&nbsp; This allows home cleaners to feel more comfortable that they will make a living wage.

<div><p>In this type of cleaning service, the cleaners come regularly based on what best suits your schedule, whether on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis.

Just want common areas and bathrooms cleaned? We can do that. Need the whole home deep cleaned? That’s perfect, too!</p><p>Once we know the details of the end of tenancy cleaning you want, we can find the service providers who best suit your requirements.

<div> <p>Deep cleaning focuses heavily on the bathroom and kitchen areas. This type of cleaning is different from standard home cleans because the home cleaner focuses on getting rid of grime and dirt in hard-to-reach places like under sinks, behind bookshelves, or inside cabinets.</p><p>If you have a home cleaner year round, it is probably not necessary to tip each time.  Instead, you can give a cash bonus or gift at the end of the year. This is very common for year round cleaners, even if you hire them directly.This is a nice way to show your appreciation and make the house cleaner feel good about his or her service. Again, it is always up to you whether you want to give some cash or gift to the maid or not.</p><p>In this guide, we are going to review etiquette for tipping your help around the house.  There are different schools of thought here, so the answer is "It Depends".</p></div>

<div> <p>Of course, if you feel that your cleaner went above and beyond or if you’re particularly satisfied with their work, you can always give a larger tip. Alternatively, if you feel that the cleaning was not up to par or if you had a negative experience, you may choose to tip less or not at all. In these cases, it’s important to communicate your concerns with the cleaning company or individual to give them the opportunity to address any issues.</p><p>Are you feeling overwhelmed by the thought of cleaning your home or apartment and have guests coming over soon? There’s great news! The Cleaning Authority offers single or one-time cleaning services – with no commitment necessary.</p><p>A private cleaner charges 20% to 50% less than a professional cleaning service, has more scheduling flexibility, and may negotiate rates.

<div><p>Tipping expectations have risen to about 15-25%, following the trend seen in other industries. Before 2019, the general rule of thumb for tipping house cleaners was around $10-$20 per service or a fixed percentage of the service cost.</p><p>A standard house cleaning costs $90 to $180 on average, and a deep-clean or move-out clean costs $130 to $400. Prices depend on the home's size and if fridge cleaning, window cleaning, or other services are included. Many professional cleaning services offer discounts for weekly or monthly cleanings.</p><p>Tipping $10 to $20 per cleaning or 10% to 15% of the total cost is greatly appreciated if the cleaner did a great job. However, cleaners are not expecting gratuity.</p></div>
